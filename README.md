# GFR

GFR (Glenn Flux Reconstruction) is a high-order computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) Fortran code for large-eddy simulations. It is based on the simple and
efficient flux reconstruction method and accurate to arbitrary order through a
user-supplied input parameter. It is currently capable of using unstructured
grids containing quadrilateral and hexahedra elements.
